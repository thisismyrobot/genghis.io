AppBridge
=========

App on mobile device (Android initially) that scans QR code on screen presented
by web IDE that I make on pytoyapp.appspot.com (later can launch via Intent on mobile browser?).

This establishes an always-on connection between website and mobile. Mobile is connected to Sphero etc.

Allows real-time control, then dev etc.

Woo!

IDEs
